#Finish the line of code that creates the areas list such that the list first contains the name of each room as a string and then its area. More #specifically, add the strings "hallway", "kitchen" and "bedroom" at the appropriate locations.

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway",hall,"kitchen", kit, "living room", liv,"bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]
