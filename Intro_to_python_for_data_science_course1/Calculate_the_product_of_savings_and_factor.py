#Calculate the product of savings and factor. Store the result in year1.
#What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
#Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
#Print out doubledesc. Did you expect this?

# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
year1 = savings * factor
print (year1)
print (type(year1))

desc = "compound interest"
doubledesc = desc + desc
print (doubledesc)
